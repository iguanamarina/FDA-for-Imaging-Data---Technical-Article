# FDA for Imaging Data - Technical Article
 In this repository I keep the codes used for the article "Applications of functional data analysis to the estimation of mean function and confidence bands for imaging data". Everything is run using R and the scripts should be complete and with enough comments for anyone to understand in case they want to replicate the results. Long life open science!
